%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MESH DEFINITION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
    MESH

%    The NODE command defines properties of the nodes.  
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       NODES, 3, 3, 1
%    Enter x,y,z coords of nodes.   The node number is optional, and is ignored in the code.
         COORDINATES
         1,  0.d0, 0.d0, 0.d0
         2,  1.d0, 0.d0, 0.d0

%     The ELEMENT command defines properties of elements
%     The parameters are no. nodes on the element, no. properties, total no. state variables, integer identifier
%     2D solid elements should be numbered between 1 and 100; 3D solid elements should be numbered between
%     1000 and 2000.
   
      ELEMENT, 8, 3, 0, 1001
%       Define element properties - the values are passed to user subroutine elstif in the order they are listed here
%       For the example provided, the params are Youngs Modulus, Poissons ratio and thermal expansion coeft
        PROPERTIES
         100.d0, 0.3d0, 0.d0
      DENSITY, 10.d0
%     Define element connectivity
%     The element number (first number in the list) is optional, and is ignored in the code
        CONNECTIVITY
    1,     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
    2,     2, 9, 10, 3, 6, 11, 12, 7

%     The ELEMENT keyword can be repeated here to define another set of elements with different properties


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BOUNDARY CONDITIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%     The BOUNDARY conditions key starts definition of BCs
      BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

%       The HISTORY key defines a time history that can be applied to DOFs or distributed loads
        HISTORY, dof_history
          0.d0, 0.d0
         10.d0, 1.d0

        HISTORY, dload_history
          0.d0, 2.d0
         10.d0, 2.d0

%       The NODESET key defines a list of nodes
        NODESET, base
           1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10
        NODESET, left
           1, 4, 5, 8
        NODESET, right
           9, 10, 12, 11
        NODESET, side
           1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 9

%      The ELEMENTSET key defines a list of elements
       ELEMENTSET, end_element
           2

%       The DEGREE OF FREEDOM key assigns values to nodal DOFs
%       The syntax is node set name, DOF number, and either a value or a history name.
%     
        DEGREES OF FREEDOM
           base, 3, 0.d0
           side, 2, 0.d0

%           right, 1, dof_history
        END DEGREES OF FREEDOM


%       The DISTRIBUTED LOAD key sets up prescribed tractions on element faces
%       The syntax is one of the following options:
%           element set, face #, VALUE, tx,ty,(tz)        (applies constant pressure to element face in direction DOF)
%           element set, face #, history name, nx,ny,(nz) (time dependent pressure to element face in direction (nx,ny,nz))
%           element set, face #, NORMAL, history name     (applies time dependent pressure normal to element face)
%           element set, face #, SUBROUTINE, list of parameters

        DISTRIBUTED LOADS
          end_element, 4, Value, 10.d0,0.d0,0.d0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Mesh printing, error checking %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%  Print the initial mesh to a file named initial_mesh.dat

   PRINT, initial_mesh.dat

%      The ALL NODES option forces quadratic elements to be subdivided for TECPLOT plotting purposes.
       MESH, ALL NODES






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Analysis %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%   The EXPLICIT DYNAMIC STEP key initializes a dynamic load step

     EXPLICIT DYNAMIC STEP

%        The TIME STEP key defines values of parameters controlling time stepping.
%        The parameters are time step, no. steps, no. steps between state prints, no. steps between user prints
%        All parameters are required

          TIME STEP, 0.01, 200,10,200


%        Project element state to nodes (for contour plotting, etc).  The integer specifies # of states to project.
%        You can also use PROJECT STATE, # states, LUMPED PROJECTION MATRIX - this does the state projection
%        using a lumped approximation to the projection matrix.  This is much faster, and uses far
%        less memory, but slightly less accurate.  

         PROJECT STATE, 6

%      This prints the DOF values and projected nodal state for all solid elements to a tecplot readable file
%      Nodal variables are printed as
%         X, Y, (Z), Ux, Uy, (Uz), Projected states
         PRINT
           MESH, contourplots.dat

%      This activates the user subroutine controlled printing
%        PRINT
%          USER
%          List file names to contain the output. 
%          FILES
%            filename1.dat
%            filename2.dat
%          PARAMETERS
%            list of parameters to be passed to the subroutine

        END EXPLICIT DYNAMIC STEP
