Features tested
User subroutine to define the element mass matrix, element operator matrix, and right-hand side vector.

Problem description
The finite element model for each test case consists of two separate but identical meshes of a simple truss. One mesh consists of five T3D2 elements, and the other consists of five equivalent user-defined elements.

Four test cases are performed as described below.

uellinea.inp
In this problem a linear analysis is run that uses the data line input option to specify the stiffness and mass matrix of the user element. This means that the subroutine is not used, but rather the stiffness and mass matrix for the user element are tested. One end of the truss is constrained. In the first step a load is applied at the second end of the truss. In the second step the eigenfrequencies of the truss are calculated.

uelnonli.inp
The same problem is solved as in uellinea.inp, but the user subroutine is used. The problem is still linear, but there is no assumption of linearity in the user-defined element.

uelriksx.inp
In this job the load is applied gradually using the modified Riks method for proportional loading cases.

ueldynam.inp
In this case the load is applied instantaneously as the implicit dynamics procedure is used to calculate the results for the first 10 increments.

Results and discussion
The verification consists of comparing the results from the T3D2 models to the results obtained from the user element models, since they should be identical.
