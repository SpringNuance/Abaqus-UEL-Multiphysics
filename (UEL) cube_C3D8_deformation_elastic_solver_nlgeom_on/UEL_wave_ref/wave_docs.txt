Wave utility subroutines
Features tested
User subroutine to test the utility subroutines for fluid kinematic data in Abaqus/Aqua analyses.

Problem description
Warning:
A dummy user element is used to call the utility subroutines for fluid kinematic data. The fluid kinematic data are requested at different points. Three test cases are performed.


Results and discussion
The verification consists of comparing the results returned by the utility subroutines with the results from the wave theory. The results from the wave theory are given in the input files as comment lines.

Input files
uelutwv1.inp
Gets the velocities and accelerations from the utility subroutine GETWAVEVEL for a Stokes' wave at a few points.

uelutwv1.f
User subroutine UEL used in uelutwv1.inp.

uelutwv2.inp
Gets the velocities and accelerations from the utility subroutine GETWAVEVEL for an Airy wave at a few points.

uelutwv2.f
User subroutine UEL used in uelutwv2.inp.

uelutwv3.inp
Gets the steady current velocities and wind velocities from the utility subroutines GETCURRVEL and GETWINDVEL, respectively, for points below and above the still fluid surface.

uelutwv3.f
User subroutine UEL used in uelutwv3.inp.
